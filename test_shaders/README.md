# WGSL Shader Documentation

Welcome to the generated documentation for your WGSL shader modules!

This site provides a structured, searchable, and readable reference for all your WGSL code, including:
- **Modules**: Each `.wgsl` file is documented as a module, with its own page.
- **Structures**: All structs, their fields, and documentation comments.
- **Functions**: All functions, arguments, return types, and inline documentation.
- **Imports**: Cross-module type and function references are resolved and linked.
- **Type Information**: All types, including primitives, vectors, and user-defined types, are clearly displayed.

## How to Use

- **Browse Modules**: Use the navigation to explore different shader modules.
- **Read Docs**: Click on any structure or function to see its documentation, signature, and usage.
- **Cross References**: Jump between modules and types using links generated from imports.
